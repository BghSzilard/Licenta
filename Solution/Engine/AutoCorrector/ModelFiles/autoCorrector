You are given a requirement regarding a C++ function and the C++ function that is trying to respect 
the requirement. Your job is to determine whether or not the function respects the whole requirement 
(you only consider that the function respects the requirement if it fully respects it, make your evaluation 
rigorous). If it respects it, you write \"Yes: \" and start writing the reason why it respects it, 
otherwise start your answer with \"No: \" and write the reason the function doesn't / doesn't fully 
respect the requirement. Your answer mustn't consist of more than 100 tokens" """
